title: Transaction Fees
description: Understanding and optimizing transaction costs on HashKey Chain
---

HashKey Chain employs a dual-fee structure that provides the security of Ethereum while maintaining cost efficiency. Understanding how fees work is essential for developers building applications on the network.

## Fee Structure Overview

Every transaction on HashKey Chain includes two distinct cost components, each serving a different purpose in the network's architecture:

| Fee Component | Purpose | Variability | Primary Factor |
|---------------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| L2 Execution Fee | Processing transactions on HashKey Chain | Medium | HashKey Chain network congestion |
| L1 Security Fee | Publishing data to Ethereum mainnet | High | Ethereum gas prices |

### L1 Security Fee

The L1 Security Fee represents the cost of posting transaction data to Ethereum mainnet, which is essential for HashKey Chain's security model as a Layer 2 solution.

#### Key Characteristics

- Fluctuates significantly based on Ethereum mainnet gas prices
- Often constitutes the larger portion of the total transaction cost
- Calculated based on the data size of your transaction
- Benefits from Ethereum's data compression techniques

### L2 Execution Fee

The L2 Execution Fee covers the computational resources required to execute your transaction on HashKey Chain itself.

#### Key Characteristics

- Based on a gas model similar to Ethereum
- Typically more stable and predictable than L1 fees
- Adjusts dynamically based on HashKey Chain network utilization
- Generally much lower than equivalent transactions on Ethereum mainnet

# Bridges

## Overview

Bridges are essential infrastructure components that facilitate the secure transfer of assets and data between HashKey Chain and other networks like Ethereum. They enable interoperability between blockchains, allowing decentralized applications (dApps) to leverage the advantages of multiple networks.

## Available Bridges

The following bridges provide secure and efficient connectivity between HashKey Chain and Ethereum:

### Superbridge

[Superbridge](https://bridge.hashkeychain.net) enables secure transfer of HSK and other supported assets from Ethereum mainnet (L1) directly to HashKey Chain.

**Testnet Environment:** [HashKey Chain Testnet Bridge](https://hashkey-testnet-51efbf722023210f.testnets.rollbridge.app/)

### Orbiter Finance

[Orbiter Finance](https://www.orbiter.finance/en?src_chain=177\&tgt_chain=1\&src_token=ETH) provides trustless cross-rollup transactions of Ethereum and Bitcoin native assets in a seamless manner.

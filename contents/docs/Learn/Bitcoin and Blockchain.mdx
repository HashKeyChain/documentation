# Bitcoin and blockchain

## Bitcoin and blockchain
Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 by an individual or group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto through the whitepaper Bitcoin: [A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System (Bitcoin Whitepaper)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). Prompted by the 2008 financial crisis, Nakamoto envisioned a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin's design emphasizes trustlessness, transparency, and resistance to censorship, offering an alternative to centralized financial systems.

The genesis block of Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009, marking the birth of the first blockchain. This block contained a message: "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks," referencing a headline from The Times newspaper and embedding a timestamp that proved the block couldn't have been created before that date. 

## How Bitcoin Works

### Proof of Work (PoW)
Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain, earning bitcoins and transaction fees. This process secures the network but is energy-intensive. <!-- 增加跳转 -->

### Block Structure
Each block includes a header (with the previous block's hash, timestamp, Merkle root, and nonce) and a list of transactions.

### Transaction Verification
Nodes verify transactions by checking digital signatures and ensuring inputs are unspent, preventing double-spending.

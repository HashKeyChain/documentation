# Ethereum: The World Computer

## Introduction to Ethereum

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that enables the creation and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Launched in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and a team of co-founders, Ethereum expanded blockchain technology beyond simple currency transactions to a programmable platform.

Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a digital currency and payment system, Ethereum was designed as a comprehensive platform for building decentralized applications. It introduced the concept of a "world computer" - a globally distributed computing infrastructure that executes programs exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.

## The Ethereum Whitepaper

In late 2013, Vitalik Buterin published the [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/), outlining his vision for a platform that would go beyond Bitcoin's capabilities. The whitepaper described Ethereum as:

> "A Next-Generation Smart Contract and Decentralized Application Platform."

The document explained how Ethereum would enable developers to create applications with built-in economic functions via its Turing-complete programming language. This innovation allowed for the creation of complex self-executing contracts governed by code rather than central authorities.

Key concepts introduced in the whitepaper include:
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with terms written in code
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: A runtime environment for executing smart contracts
- **Ether (ETH)**: The native cryptocurrency used to power transactions on the network
- **Gas**: A measurement unit for computational work on the network

## Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Key Differences

While Bitcoin and Ethereum both use blockchain technology, they serve fundamentally different purposes:

| Feature | Bitcoin | Ethereum |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Primary Purpose | Digital currency and store of value | Smart contract platform and decentralized computing |
| Creation Date | 2009 | 2015 |
| Founder | Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym) | Vitalik Buterin and co-founders |
| Block Time | ~10 minutes | ~12-14 seconds |
| Supply Model | Fixed supply (21 million) | No fixed supply cap (after the merge) |
| Consensus Mechanism | Proof of Work | Proof of Stake (after the merge) |
| Programmability | Limited script functionality | Fully programmable smart contracts |

## Ethereum's Evolution and Major Upgrades

Ethereum has undergone several significant upgrades since its launch:

### Frontier (July 2015)
The initial bare-bones version of Ethereum, allowing developers to mine ETH and build upon the network.

### Homestead (March 2016)
The first stable Ethereum release, introducing various protocol improvements.

### DAO Fork (July 2016)
A controversial hard fork that reversed the infamous DAO hack, leading to the creation of Ethereum Classic (ETC).

### Metropolis (October 2017 and February 2019)
Implemented in two phases (Byzantium and Constantinople), bringing enhanced security and scalability.

### Istanbul (December 2019)
Introduced improvements to gas costs and interoperability with Zcash.

### Beacon Chain Launch (December 2020)
The first step towards Ethereum 2.0, introducing Proof of Stake.

### London Upgrade (August 2021)
Implemented EIP-1559, changing the fee market and introducing a token burning mechanism.

### The Merge (September 2022)
Perhaps the most significant upgrade, transitioning Ethereum from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake, reducing energy consumption by ~99.95%.

### Shanghai Upgrade (April 2023)
Enabled staked ETH withdrawals and implemented various optimizations.

### Cancun-Deneb (March 2024)
Introduced proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to reduce costs for rollups and additional improvements.

## Understanding Layer 1 and Layer 2 Solutions

### Layer 1: The Base Blockchain

Ethereum is a [Layer 1](/docs/Knowledge/layer-1) blockchain, meaning it's a base blockchain protocol that validates and finalizes transactions on its own network. As the foundation of the ecosystem, Ethereum provides:

- Security through its consensus mechanism
- Decentralization via thousands of nodes worldwide
- Native token (ETH) for transactions and network operation
- Smart contract functionality

Despite its capabilities, Ethereum faces the blockchain trilemma - the challenge of optimizing for security, decentralization, and scalability simultaneously.

### Layer 2: Scaling Solutions

To address scalability limitations, [Layer 2](/docs/Knowledge/layer-2) solutions have been developed. These are protocols built on top of Ethereum that handle transactions off the main chain while inheriting its security. Major Layer 2 solutions include:

- **Rollups (Optimistic and Zero-Knowledge)**: Process transactions off-chain and post compressed data to Ethereum
- **State Channels**: Enable users to conduct transactions off-chain and only settle the final state on Ethereum
- **Plasma Chains**: Create child chains that handle specific applications with their own consensus mechanisms
- **Validiums**: Similar to rollups but store data off-chain for greater scalability

## Ethereum and Hashkey Chain

Hashkey Chain is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Ethereum's foundation. As an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, it offers:

1. **Lower Transaction Costs**: By processing transactions off the main Ethereum chain
2. **Higher Throughput**: Capable of handling more transactions per second
3. **Ethereum Compatibility**: Supporting Ethereum's development tools and smart contracts
4. **Bridge Functionality**: Allowing assets to move between Ethereum and Hashkey Chain

Hashkey Chain leverages Ethereum's security while addressing its scalability limitations, making it particularly suitable for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFT marketplaces, and enterprise solutions.

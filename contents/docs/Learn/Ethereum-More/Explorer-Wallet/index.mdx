# Blockchain Explorer Guide: Understanding Key Metrics

Blockchain explorers serve as windows into blockchain networks, providing real-time data about transactions, blocks, addresses, and network health. This guide focuses on how to navigate and interpret key metrics on Ethereum and HashKey Chain explorers.

## Introduction to Blockchain Explorers

Blockchain explorers are web applications that index and present blockchain data in user-friendly interfaces. They allow users to:

- Track transactions and confirm their status
- View block information and network activity
- Investigate addresses and smart contracts
- Monitor network health and performance metrics
- Verify and interact with smart contracts

## HashKey Chain Explorer

### Getting Started with HashKey Chain Explorer

Follow these simple steps to start using the HashKey Chain Explorer effectively:

2. Click the "Connect" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your preferred wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
4. Approve the connection request in your wallet
5. Once connected, your address will appear in the top-right corner

Connecting your wallet allows you to:
- View your personal transaction history
- Monitor your token balances directly
- Interact with verified smart contracts
- Add addresses to your watchlist

#### Step 2: Search for Blockchain Data

The search bar is your primary tool for finding information:

1. Click on the search bar at the top of the page
2. Enter any of the following:
   - Transaction hash (0x...)
   - Address (0x...)
   - Block number
   - Token name or symbol
3. Press Enter or click the search icon
4. The explorer will direct you to the relevant information page

#### Step 3: Explore Network Dashboard

The homepage displays key network metrics:

1. Review the summary statistics at the top:
   - Total blocks
   - Average block time
   - Total transactions
   - Wallet addresses count
2. Scroll down to view recent blocks and transactions
3. Check the Gas Tracker for current transaction fee estimates

#### Step 4: Analyze Token Markets and Activity

To explore tokens on the network:

1. Click on the "Tokens" tab in the main navigation
2. Browse the list of tokens sorted by market cap, volume, or holders
3. Click on any token to view detailed information:
   - Price history
   - Total supply
   - Holder distribution
   - Transfer activity
   - Contract details

### Transaction Monitoring

To investigate specific transactions:

## Developer-Focused Features

Both explorers offer tools specifically useful for developers:

### Contract Verification

Verify your smart contract source code to make it publicly available and auditable:

1. Navigate to "Verify Contract" in the explorer
2. Input contract address and deployment parameters
3. Upload source code and compiler settings
4. Submit for verification

Once verified, users can interact with your contract directly through the explorer interface.

### API Integration

Access blockchain data programmatically through explorer APIs:

HashKey Chain Explorer offers:
- REST API for basic data retrieval
- GraphQL for complex queries
- RPC API for node-like interaction

Example API request to get address transactions:
```javascript
async function getAddressTransactions(address) {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://explorer.hsk.xyz/api/v2/addresses/${address}/transactions`
  );
  return await response.json();
}
```

## Security Considerations

When using blockchain explorers, keep these security practices in mind:

1. **Bookmark official explorer URLs** to avoid phishing sites
2. **Never connect your wallet** to an explorer unless absolutely necessary
3. **Verify contract source code** before interacting with smart contracts
4. **Cross-check important transactions** across multiple explorers
5. **Log out of connected wallets** after completing your session
6. **Keep your wallet software updated** for security patches
7. **Use read-only wallet connections** when only viewing data is needed

## Conclusion

Blockchain explorers are essential tools for transparency and analytics in blockchain networks. Both HashKey Chain Explorer and OKLink offer comprehensive views into network activity, transaction details, and address behaviors. Understanding how to interpret these metrics helps users make informed decisions and developers build better blockchain applications.

# Ethereum Development Technologies

This document explores the core technologies underlying Ethereum, their implementation details, and how developers can leverage these technologies to build decentralized applications.

## Consensus Mechanisms

Ethereum has undergone a significant transition in its consensus mechanism, moving from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake with "The Merge" upgrade in 2022.

### Comparison of Consensus Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Energy Usage | Throughput | Finality | Security Model | Examples | More Info |
|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|----------------|----------|-----------|
| **Proof of Work (PoW)** | Very High | Low (10-15 TPS) | Probabilistic | Based on computational power | Bitcoin, Ethereum (pre-Merge), Litecoin | [PoW](/docs/Knowledge/pow) |
| **Proof of Stake (PoS)** | Low | Medium (25-100 TPS) | Faster, deterministic | Based on economic stake | Ethereum (post-Merge), Cardano, Avalanche | [PoS](/docs/Knowledge/pos) |
| **Delegated PoS (DPoS)** | Low | High (1000+ TPS) | Near-instant | Relies on elected block producers | EOS, Tron, BNB Chain | [DPoS](/docs/Knowledge/dpos) |
| **Proof of Authority (PoA)** | Very Low | Very High | Instant | Based on identity of validators | Most testnets, sidechains | [PoA](/docs/Knowledge/poa) |

### Ethereum's Consensus Evolution

1. **Ethash PoW (2015-2022)**
   - Mining-based consensus using memory-hard algorithms
   - Required specialized hardware (GPUs) for efficient mining
   - High energy consumption but established security model

2. **Casper PoS (2022-Present)**
   - Validators stake 32 ETH to participate in block validation
   - Slashing conditions penalize malicious behavior
   - Reduced energy usage by ~99.95%
   - Enhanced finality and security properties

3. **Future: Sharding**
   - Horizontal scaling solution planned for future upgrades
   - Will divide network into parallel segments to increase throughput
   - Maintains security through random validator assignment

## Core Development Technologies

Ethereum introduced several revolutionary technologies that form the foundation of its ecosystem.

### Smart Contract Development

Smart contracts are self-executing code deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. 

#### Smart Contract Languages

|----------|----------|----------------|----------|----------|
| **Solidity** | Static typing, inheritance, libraries | Moderate | High | Most applications |
| **Vyper** | Python-like, no recursion, bounded loops | Moderate | Medium | Security-critical contracts |
| **Fe** | Rust-inspired, type safety | Steep | Low (emerging) | Experimental projects |
| **Yul** | Low-level intermediate language | Very steep | Medium | Gas optimization |

- **Opcodes**: Low-level instructions for contract execution
- **Gas metering**: Measures computational effort to prevent infinite loops
- **Deterministic execution**: Same inputs always produce same outputs

The EVM serves as the computational heart of Ethereum, with its design enabling compatibility across multiple blockchains, including HashKey Chain.
